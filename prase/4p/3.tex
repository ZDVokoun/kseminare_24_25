\begin{document}

We know that each combination of three points lay on a line or form a triangle. Therefore, considering some points $A$, $B$, $C$, we know that:

\[
  |\angle ABC| + |\angle BCA| + |\angle CAB| = 180^{\circ}
\]
\[
  |\angle CBA| + |\angle BAC| + |\angle ACB| = 180^{\circ}
\]

Thus, the average these angles is $60^{\circ}$ and when doing this for all combinations of three points we will get identical result. Consequently, the average number will be $60^{\circ}$ because by doing this we cover all possible ordered triplets.
